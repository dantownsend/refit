Contributing
============

Mixins
------
The easiest way to contribute is to add new Mixins, or extend existing ones,
with common functionality.

Style Guide
-----------
The Black formatter is used, with a line length of 79 to make it consistent
with PEP8.

Tests
-----
Some tests require Docker to be running, so Refit can actually SSH onto a
server to execute commands.
